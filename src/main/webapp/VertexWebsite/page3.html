    <h4> Safin scored an All India Rank of 570 and by doing that, he proved his hard work to the country and established a record of being the youngest IPS officer at the young age of 22 years old.</h4>
<p>
&nbps &nbps Safin Hasan is another such living example who cleared the UPSC examination at an extremely young age and by doing that, he made another record of being the youngest IPS officer in the country. He cleared his examination in his first attempt at the extremely young age of 22 years.
&nbps &nbps Safin Hasan was born and brought up on 21 July 1995 in Kanodar village of Palanpur district, Gujarat in a financially deficit household so his early life was not very smooth sailing. His childhood is a product of the struggles a common lower-middle-class family faces throughout their life, scrimping for money, food, and basic essentials to survive in India to even keep the members of the family well and alive.

<h3>Hasan’s Struggles and Preparation for UPSC</h3>
&nbps &nbps Besides all the hard work his parents put into his education Safin also received timely assistance from strangers including local businessman Hussain Polra and his wife Raina Polra. They spent money from their own pocket to fund Safin’s two-year stay in the national capital, including the fees of a coaching institute, his travel, and lodgings for his civil services preparation.
&nbps &nbps His expenses for civil services and examination were also borne by a couple named Husainbhai and Jarinaben. When he was in Delhi preparing for his exams, he frequently used to meet IAS and IPS officers for guidance. He treats these people who helped him unconditionally achieve his dreams as a family even though they share no actual blood ties.

<h3>Safin Hasan’s Inspiration and Role Model</h3>
<p>&nbps &nbps Once a collector visited his school and Safin was awe-struck by the way the IAS officer as a person commanded so much respect and had so much security around him. Even his school principal treated him differently.
&nbps &nbps The little boy returned home and asked around what was so special about the visitor and he was told that the guest was an IAS officer and that he worked to solve problems for common people so everyone treated him like a king. He was told that being in civil services is a respectable job and it needs sheer dedication and hard work to be one. From there Safin decided that he wanted to be an IAS officer.</p>
